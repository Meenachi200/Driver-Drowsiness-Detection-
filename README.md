# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-
### Abstract: Driver Drowsiness Detection System Using IoT and Arduino 

Driver drowsiness is a significant cause of road accidents, leading to injuries, fatalities, and property damage. To address this issue, this project proposes an IoT-based **Driver Drowsiness Detection System** that uses a PC-connected camera and an Arduino microcontroller to monitor and alert drowsy drivers in real time.  

The system employs a camera to continuously capture the driverâ€™s face and analyze eye movements to determine if the eyes are open or closed. If the eyes remain closed for more than 3 seconds, the system triggers an alarm using a buzzer and activates a vibration motor. These warning mechanisms help alert the driver and prevent potential accidents. The alarm deactivates once the driver reopens their eyes.  

This solution leverages low-cost components and integrates computer vision with IoT to create an efficient and scalable safety mechanism. The system's simple yet effective design ensures real-time drowsiness detection, making it suitable for integration into vehicles or as an add-on safety device.  

Key highlights of this project include its ease of implementation, real-time responsiveness, and potential to significantly reduce road accidents caused by drowsy driving.
